# MathException.java
Create a superclass MathException and two subclasses OverFlowException and UnderFlowException. If input > 100, an OverFlowException is thrown, otherwise if input &lt; 0 an UnderFlowException is thrown. Now, write three catch blocks for MathException, OverFlowException and for UnderFlowException. In the first catch block re-throw the exception caught.
